# appdeploy
## Custom controller to deploy app and cache datastore

## Description
Controller app-deploy built using [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/). Installing this will install a crd resource with name `myappresources.deploy.my.api.group` and once the controller is deployed, it will read crd objects of kind `MyAppResource` and create resources. Definition for this file is [here](./config/crd/bases/deploy.my.api.group_myappresources.yaml). A sample crd kubernetes manifest containing relevant specs can be referenced [here](./config/samples/deploy_v1alpha1_myappresource.yaml). 

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 20.10+.
- kubectl version v1.24+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.24+ cluster.

### Compile and build
```sh
make all
```
To Compile the code and build binary on local machine run the above command<br>
The definition for all make commands can be referenced in [file](./Makefile). `make all` uses controller-gen to generate crds,rbac and manifests based on code

### Test
```sh
make test
```
Currently only one test case is written for validating that the resources will get created.<br>
TO:DO test cases to cover updates to crd and deleting crds

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<user-registry>/appdeploy:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry.<br> 
Ensure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.<br>
For controller to be deployed, k8s should have access to pull image from this registry

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Controller Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<user-registry>/appdeploy:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**To deploy custom resource**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```
If you prefer a different custom resource yaml manifest, you can provide that instead of editing this [file](./config/samples/deploy_v1alpha1_myappresource.yaml)

### Validation
Based on the values provided in the custom resource, you should be able to see kubernetes resources created in the cluster<br>
Modify values in the custom resource and apply again with 
```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```
The controller will configure resources based on the changes and it can be validated by inspecting the resources.<br>

### Application verification
**Port Forwarding to access UI**<br>
```sh
kubectl port-forward deploy/<deployment_name> 9898:9898
```
The app runs on port 9898 and running this command will make the app available on your localhost on the same port.<br>
This can be accessed in the web browser by opening http://localhost:9898 after you run the port-forward command.<br>

### Cache function verification

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

**NOTE** Deleting only the crd will also delete all resources
